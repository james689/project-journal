A Java desktop GUI application for project journal management.

In summary the application allows the user to:

Create a journal for a project they are working on.

Add entries to the journal, including the amount of time spent working on the project for each entry.

View the entries in a journal and summary data about the journal, such as the total amount of time
spent working on the project and total number of journal entries.

The application uses an embedded Java DB database to store the journal data. This
database is created in the user's home directory by default.
